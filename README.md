# Parking Manager circuit

My Project is a Parking Manager circuit that is capable of managing enter and exit of two types of cars, uni_cars (teaches' cars) and cars (students' cars).
see the Doc.pdf file for more details.

## Tools
- Modelsim and Verilog HDL
- Quartus (for synthesize)


## Implementation Details

I use Verilog HDL to make two modules, TimeHandler Module to simulate time spending per hour, and the main module (Parking) that is the backend of parking managering.

## How to Run

Just open the files in modelsim and use simulation to see waveforms.
Or see the Doc.pdf file for more details.




## Results
see Synthesize.pdf

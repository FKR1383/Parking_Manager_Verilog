# Parking Manager circuit

My Project is a Parking Manager circuit that is capable of managing enter and exit of two types of cars, uni_cars and cars (normal cars).


## Tools
- Modelsim and Verilog HDL
- Quartus


## Implementation Details

I use Verilog HDL to make two modules, TimeHandler Module to simulate time spending per hour, and the main module (Parking) that is the backend of parking managering.

## How to Run

Just open the files in modelsim and use simulation to see waveforms.





## Results
see Synthesize.pdf
